FUNCTIONS
    docFrequency(vocab, dict)
        The number of docs containing the word.
        We use count dictionary to return the df dictionary.
    
    inverseDocFreq(vocab, doc_fre, length)
        returns idf dictionary.

    invertedindex(dict)
        In this function we remove stop words and also
        stem the words using ntlk PorterStemmer library.
        This function takes the dict as input and returns
        list of words which are not in stop words. Also we precompute
        word_in_doc and count dictionary to be use in other function.
    
    read_files(path)
        this function takes input absolute path of the dataset
        and returns a dictionary dict which has docs name as key and
        the value as the text of the docs.
    
    termFrequency(vocab, dict)
        Term frequency is how many times a term is present in the doc.
        We use the count dictionary that we computed aleady.
    
    tfidf(vocab, tf, idf_scr, doc_dict)
        Calculate tf-idf to be used in calculating the score of query.
    
    vectorSpaceModel(query, doc_dict, tfidf_scr, vocab)
	Calculates relevant documents related to the query.
