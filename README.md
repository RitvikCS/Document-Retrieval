>LOAD CUSTOM DATASETS INTO PROGRAMS
> 1. open ir_asst1.py source file,
> 2. in driver code...
>> * change the value of path to your custom dataset folder in path_to_folder variable. 
>> * In the path_to_folder variable, replace all the back slashes('\') with forward slashes('/').

**Dataset must be in txt format to parse.**
